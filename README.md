# DSA-project

This project is a project for the upcoming DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. The project will be implemented using **Python**. The datasets to be used and the methods to be applied are still being determined. This README file provides the basic information about the project and outlines the upcoming steps.

## Datasets

The data will be obtained from specific dataset or source, if not specified, "various open data sources". Currently, work is being done on determining the contents of the dataset and how it will be collected. Potential data sources include:

- Web scraping
- APIs
- Open datasets

These options will be explored.

## Technological Choices

The project will be carried out solely using the **Python** programming language. Python is preferred due to its powerful libraries and tools for data analysis and processing. The main libraries that might be used include:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Requests/BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping (if data collection is required)
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning and modeling (if the project involves machine learning)

## Data Collection Plan

The following methods will be considered for data collection:

- **Web Scraping**: Data may be collected from specific websites using tools like `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy`.
- **API Usage**: Data can be retrieved via APIs. The `Requests` and `json` libraries will be used to make API requests and collect data.
- **Manual Data Collection**: If open datasets are used, data collection may be done manually.

Each method and data source will be documented appropriately.

## Code Requirements

- All code will be written in **Python**.
- The code must be well-documented, with comments explaining each function and important steps.
- All dependencies for the project will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

## Project Plan

1. **Identify Data Sources**: At the beginning of the project, potential data sources will be identified.
2. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Data will be collected from the selected sources and prepared for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis and Modeling**: The data will be analyzed, and models will be created if needed.
4. **Evaluation of Results**: The results obtained will be evaluated, and a report will be generated.

## Dependencies

A `requirements.txt` file will be created to list the Python libraries required for the project. This file will contain all the dependencies necessary for the project to run.

Since the project topic is still being defined, the details and methodology are under careful consideration and will be finalized in the near future.
